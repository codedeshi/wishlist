Simple webpage built using Flask and MySQL. User can register/log and create items that are directly added to their wish list. User can also see items created by others and who all have added that item to their list and can also add it their own wish list by clicking a link. If the user has an item created by someone else they can remove it from their list but if they have created the item they can delete the item completely.
